### Programming Assignment 1
Implements a hash table class. Then, uses this implementation to read a provided "dictionary" text file and spell check a "document" text file. 

### Programming Assignment 2
Implements a Binary Min Heap, providing programmers with the functionality of a priority queue using binary heap implementation. Each item inserted will specify a unique string ID, an integer key, and an optional pointer. Uses hash table from Programming Assignment 1.

### Programming Assignment 3
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm using a graph. The objective is to solve the single-source shortest-path problem, determining the shortest path in a specified graph from a specified starting vertex to each other vertex in the graph. Uses Binary Heap from Programming Assignment 2.

### Programming Assignment 4
A problem from the 1998 regional ACM Programming Contest that defines a "merge" of two strings as a third string containing all the characters from each of the original two strings mixed together. This program determines if a string is a valid merge of two other strings.
